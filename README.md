![logo](images/turned-gray-laptop-computer.jpg)


## Description

In this Course Assignment we had to build a portfolio webpage that lists these 3 projects we worked on these two semesters. The projects should list as cards, and each card must have:

- the title of the project
- a description,
- a screenshot of how the project looks when running,
- a link to the GitHub repo and a live site if it is online.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

### Installing 

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git@github.com:mariajaro/portfolio.git
```

2. Original repo is on Noroff GitHub:

```bash
git@github.com:Noroff-FEU-Assignments/project-exam-1-mariajaro.git
```

### Running

This project contains only static files, so it will pretty much run on all devices. Just go into the root folder where you cloned this repo, and double click on index.html to run the file in your browser.
